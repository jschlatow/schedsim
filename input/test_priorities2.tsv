# This test comprises two periodic threads on priority 1 with same period,
# runtime and weight. In sum, both threads load the CPU to 100%. By adding
# a cpu-bound thread on lower priority, we are able to evaluate whether this
# scenario leads to starvation. When all threads are assigned equal weights
# they should ideally receive a similar CPU share but threads on higher priority
# should achieve a lower latency.
#
# With base-hw, when we assign threads A and B a share of 33% each. Thread D
# is only handled after 66% of the super period has passed.
# For BVT, when all weights are set to 1, thread D will be scheduled after
# 2*(warptime+runtime) and after that at least every 2*(warptime+C).

thread	start	runtime	weight	priority
A	every 5ms	2.5ms	33	1
B	every 5ms	2.5ms	33	1
D	0s	0.1s	33	0

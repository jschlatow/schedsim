# This test comprises a long-running job A with high weight and a periodic
# thread C with small runtime on the same priority. The weight of the latter
# exactly reflects the computation requirements. For some scheduling policies
# (e.g. BVT), thread C is restricted in its execution due to its small weight.

thread	start	runtime	weight	priority
A	0s	0.2s	40	1
C	every 40ms	5ms	5	1

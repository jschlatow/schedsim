# This test comprises two periodic threads with same period, runtime and
# priority but different weight. Both threads run concurrently to a long-running
# job of another thread with less weight but same priority. For some scheduling
# policies, the difference in weights of threads A and B may influence the
# schedule and the resulting latencies.
#
# Stride scheduling deals very well with this setup in terms of maximum response
# times. Counterintuitively, for BVT, the average (mean and median) response
# times of A are better despite the lower weight of A. B gets significanly worse
# average response times compared to stride scheduling.

thread	start	runtime	weight	priority
A	every 90ms	15ms	30	1
B	every 90ms	15ms	60	1
C	0.2s	0.1s	10	1

# This test comprises two period threads with the same period, runtime, weight
# and priority. These two threads run concurrently to a long-running job with
# a smaller weight but same priority. The threads A and B should receive the
# same CPU share and achieve similar latencies.

thread	start	runtime	weight	priority
A	every 90ms	30ms	45	1
B	every 90ms	30ms	45	1
C	0.2s	0.1s	10	1

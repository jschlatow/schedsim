# This test is similar to test_sculpt1 but runs an interactive load on
# desktop priority. This way, we want to evaluate whether we are able to
# maintain a certain latency for interactive desktop threads even under high
# load on higher priorities. On the other hand, MM and DD threads must not
# be affected by warping of interactive desktop threads.

# This test comprises three periodic threads with same period and priority but
# different runtimes and weights. The runtimes are set so that each thread
# request a slightly smaller CPU share than allowed by their weight. The threads
# run concurrently to a long-running job on lower priority.
#
# From this test, we expect that threads A, B and C achieve similar response
# times. Ideally, the shorter jobs are able to finish earlier.
# Base-hw handles this scenario very well whereas for BVT, we need to give
# C a slightly larger CPU share.
#
# When we modify B's runtime to exceed its share, the service for thread D
# degrades in case of base-hw whereas BVT is able to preserve thread D's share.

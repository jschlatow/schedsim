# This test is similar to test_bvt1 but changes the runtime of threads A and B.
# For BVT, this changes 
#
# BVT achieves (significantly) better response times for A and B compared to
# stride scheduling. The larger job lengths in combination with the weight
# difference between A and B let BVT run job B ahead of A.

thread	start	runtime	weight	priority
A	every 90ms	25ms	30	1
B	every 90ms	25ms	60	1
C	0.2s	0.1s	10	1
